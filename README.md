# Fxhash_projects
Projects done using FX Hash code. Each folder contain an html file as placeholder, a p5 library code as reference, a css code for basic styling and the sketch itself. Most of the sketches were developed in Open Processing, a site for online coding with the p5 library: https://openprocessing.org

Some of the sketches do not use FX HAsh yet but are implemented using random. random() will be replaced by fx rand(). An example is the orange sketch.
